Conference sponsorship is a major institutional activity of the Center for Nonlinear Studies (CNLS). Since CNLS serves as an interface between mission critical research at LANL and the outside research community, conference sponsorship is of vital importance for the Center and the Laboratory. In particular, conference sponsorshop accomplishes the following:
- Enabling CNLS to identify and explore the widest range of nonlinear and complex systems problems
- Helping to disseminate the latest developments in nonlinear and complex systems science
- Fostering collaboration between LANL researchers and outside researchers and academia
- Helping to build new areas of research and to refine the direction of existing research areas

To learn more about obtaining conference sponsorship through CNLS, please visit our Conference Sponsorship page.
